# Project-First Host Model Discussion And Change Inventory

## Purpose

This note summarizes the VM / SSH / remote-host discussion so far and turns it
into an implementation inventory.

The core question was whether Orca should treat machines as the outermost unit:

```text
Host
  Project
    Workspace
```

or whether machines should be places where a project can run:

```text
Project
  Host setup
    Workspace
```

The current product direction is the second model.

## Short Answer

The durable model should be:

```text
Project -> ProjectHostSetup -> Workspace
```

Where:

- `Project` is the durable repo/project identity the user recognizes.
- `Host` is a local Mac, SSH target, remote runtime, VM, remote server, or
  future Orca cloud VM.
- `ProjectHostSetup` means "this project is available on this host at this
  path, with this setup state and host-specific settings."
- `Workspace` is a branch/task/worktree running from one setup on one host.

The short implementation count is: **12 major things need to change**.

Some of those are already partially implemented on this branch, but the full
end-to-end model is not done until creation, setup, settings, sidebar, routing,
compatibility, CLI, and validation all speak the same project-first language.

## Discussion So Far

### Why Host-First Is Not Enough

The host-first sidebar work is still useful. It makes it easy to see:

- which hosts exist
- which hosts are online or disconnected
- where workspaces are currently running
- which SSH or remote machine might be causing a problem

But as the default mental model, host-first can make Orca feel like the user is
switching into separate machine silos. That is not the best fit for how users
usually think about repo/worktree/task work. Users usually think "I am working
on Orca" first, then "I want this workspace to run locally or on a VM."

### Desired Mental Model

Projects/repos remain the outermost concept. Hosts are compute locations for a
project.

For a simple local-only user, Orca should still feel mostly unchanged:

```text
Orca
  feature-a
  feature-b
```

For a project that spans multiple hosts, host context should appear only where
it helps:

```text
Orca
  Local Mac
    feature-a
  openclaw 2
    fix-ssh-agent-status
```

A project can also exist only on a remote host:

```text
Linux-only Project
  GPU VM
    cuda-build-fix
```

That should be treated as normal, not as a degraded state.

### VMs, SSH, Remote Servers, And Cloud

For product/model purposes, VM is a loose term. A VM can be:

- an SSH machine
- a remote server
- a future Orca-provisioned cloud host
- a user-managed local or remote machine

The important abstraction is `Host`. Cloud VM support can later add provisioning
and billing metadata to the host/setup flow without changing the workspace
model.

### Focused Host Mode

Focused host mode is not a separate durable model. It is effectively a filter or
operational view. Selecting "Local Mac" can satisfy the same need when the user
wants to focus on local work.

Recommendation:

- keep host focus/filtering as a view affordance
- do not make it the primary data model
- hide or reduce host UI when there is only one host and no useful host choice

### Sidebar Behavior

Host visibility is still important, but the sidebar should avoid unnecessary
noise.

Suggested behavior:

- Single-host project: show the project and workspaces without a host subgroup.
- Multi-host project: show host labels or host subgroups.
- Disconnected host with existing workspaces/setup history: show it with a clear
  disconnected state and actionable wording.
- Never-connected SSH target with no project setup/workspaces: do not show it in
  the project sidebar just because it exists in connection settings.
- Host-first grouping can remain as an alternate operational view/filter.

This distinction matters because a configured SSH target is not the same as a
project being available on that host.

### Workspace Creation

Creating a workspace should eventually ask:

1. Which project?
2. Which host should run it?
3. What branch/task/workspace name?

If the project is not set up on the selected host, Orca should offer:

- clone project to that host
- import an existing folder on that host
- select a different host

The user should not have to understand repo compatibility records or old
`repoId` routing.

### Project Setup

"Add project" and "make this project available on another host" are different
actions.

Important flows:

- import a local folder as a new project
- import an SSH folder as a new project
- set up an existing project on another host
- clone an existing project onto a selected host
- when adding a new host, optionally initialize one or more projects there
- later, provision an Orca cloud VM and materialize selected projects there

### Settings

Settings need explicit ownership:

- Client settings belong to the desktop client.
- Host settings belong to a machine/runtime.
- Project settings belong to the durable project.
- Project-host setup settings belong to that project on that host.

A host dropdown or host table inside project settings is probably enough for
host-specific project settings, similar to existing Windows/WSL-specific
settings patterns.

Examples:

- app theme: client setting
- SSH connection details: host setting
- project display name/provider identity: project setting
- checkout path on `openclaw 2`: project-host setup setting
- worktree base path on local Mac: project-host setup setting

### Version Skew

Remote servers may not always match the desktop client version.

The model needs capability checks so a new client can talk to an old server
without pretending unsupported features exist. UI should disable setup/create
actions with specific reasons such as:

- host is offline
- server version does not support project-host setup APIs
- project is not set up on this host
- selected host does not support required platform/capability
- required agent/runtime is unavailable

Old client / new server should continue to work through repo/worktree
compatibility APIs where possible.

## Reference Comparison

### Superset

Superset is the closer reference for Orca's desired data model.

Its model is effectively:

```text
Project + Host -> Workspace
```

Specific lessons for Orca:

- Project identity is durable.
- A host is where the project can be materialized.
- Workspace creation targets both project and host.
- A project can be set up on multiple hosts.
- If a project is not available on a host, the UI can block and offer setup.
- Project settings can contain host-specific path/worktree settings.

This maps well to Orca because Orca already has durable repos/projects,
worktrees, agents, terminals, source control, and host-aware runtimes.

### Cmux

Cmux is more session/workspace-first.

Its model is closer to:

```text
Workspace/session -> local or remote execution context
```

Specific lessons for Orca:

- SSH should feel first class.
- Remote terminals, file views, browser panes, and localhost routing should
  follow the remote execution context.
- Reconnect and persistence behavior matter.
- Cmux is useful for SSH/session polish, but it is not the best reference for
  Orca's durable project/setup data model.

## What Needs To Change

There are **12 major change surfaces**.

### 1. Shared Data Model

Current `Repo` mixes durable project identity with host-local checkout details.
The new model needs first-class project/setup concepts.

Needs:

- `Project`
- `Host`
- `ProjectHostSetup`
- explicit workspace ownership by `projectId`, `hostId`, and
  `projectHostSetupId`
- compatibility projection from old repo-shaped records

Current branch status: partially implemented.

### 2. Persistence And Migration

Existing users need a boring migration.

Needs:

- derive one project per reliable durable identity
- derive one setup per existing repo checkout
- avoid merging same-name folders unless provider identity is reliable
- preserve old ids or aliases where compatibility requires it
- backfill existing workspaces with project/setup ownership when safe

Current branch status: partially implemented.

### 3. Runtime And Request Ownership

The UI can be project-first, but execution still happens on a host.

Needs:

- route terminals, agents, filesystem, browser, source control, hooks, and
  automations through the workspace's owning host
- avoid using the currently focused host as a hidden global default for
  workspace-owned operations
- scope cancellation and stale-response handling to the host/setup that owns the
  request

Current branch status: partially implemented by multi-host groundwork; still
needs a project/setup audit.

### 4. Workspace Creation

Creation must target a project and host, not only a repo id.

Needs:

- project picker
- run-on host picker
- unavailable-host reasons
- inline clone/import setup actions
- compatibility resolver from `{ projectId, hostId }` to current repo/setup
  internals while old APIs remain

Current branch status: partially implemented. Ready project-host setups can be
selected from the composer `Run on` menu, and known hosts that still need setup
now appear as disabled rows instead of being invisible. Inline setup actions for
those rows are still missing.

### 5. Project Setup Flow

"Add repo" becomes a family of project/setup flows.

Needs:

- import existing folder on local host
- import existing folder over SSH
- clone project onto selected host
- set up an existing project on another host
- bulk setup when adding a new host
- future cloud provisioning hook

Current branch status: existing-folder setup is partially implemented through
API/CLI plumbing and a project settings import form for known local, SSH, and
active runtime hosts. Clone, provisioning, and bulk setup are not complete.

### 6. Sidebar Row Model

The sidebar should be built from projects, hosts, setups, and workspaces rather
than repo-only grouping.

Needs:

- project-first grouping
- host labels/subgroups only when useful
- host filters and online/offline status retained
- clear disconnected-host behavior
- drag/reorder rules for projects, host sections, and workspaces

Current branch status: project grouping exists for durable project/setup
identity, and the default all-host Projects view now keeps project grouping
outermost. Host headers remain for explicit host visibility filters and
operational grouping modes. Mixed-host project groups now show first-pass host
context badges on workspace cards, while single-host project groups omit them.
Electron validation and disconnected-host polish remain.

### 7. Project Settings

Project settings need a global area plus host-specific setup sections.

Needs:

- project-global settings
- host-specific paths, worktree paths, setup scripts, and platform constraints
- host dropdown/table inside settings
- provider-neutral source-control settings

Current branch status: in progress. Project settings now include an
available-hosts table, navigation between setup-specific settings panes, and an
existing-folder import form. The full ownership split is not complete.

### 8. Host Settings

Host settings should describe the machine/runtime, not duplicate every project
setting.

Needs:

- connection details
- display name
- health/status
- server version and protocol compatibility
- platform/capabilities
- host-wide defaults and overrides

Current branch status: multi-host settings groundwork exists; needs to align
with project-host setup settings.

### 9. Version And Capability Compatibility

New clients and old servers will coexist.

Needs:

- host capability probing
- fallback projection when project/setup APIs are missing
- disabled states with specific reasons
- structured errors for unsupported old-server actions
- old client / new server behavior that degrades safely

Current branch status: runtime compatibility exists; project/setup capability
gating needs to be layered on.

### 10. Caches And Local State

Some caches are project-global; many are host/setup-local.

Needs:

- classify caches as project, host, setup, or workspace scoped
- include host/setup ids in cache keys for refs, git status, filesystem state,
  capabilities, terminals, browser sessions, and remote results
- prevent a response from one host from overwriting another host's state for the
  same project

Current branch status: partially addressed for host partitioning; needs a
project/setup ownership audit.

### 11. CLI And API

External commands should speak project-first language.

Needs:

- `orca project list`
- `orca project setups`
- `orca project setup-existing-folder --project <id> --host <id> --path <path>`
- `orca worktree create --project <id> --host <id> ...`
- `orca worktree create --project-host-setup <id> ...`
- compatibility aliases for old repo/worktree commands
- structured availability errors

Current branch status: partially implemented.

### 12. Tests And Verification

This crosses storage, routing, UI, SSH, and compatibility.

Needs:

- migration tests
- selector/sidebar grouping tests
- create-workspace tests
- setup-on-host tests
- settings ownership tests
- SSH end-to-end validation
- version mismatch tests
- Electron validation for sidebar, creation, and settings

Current branch status: model/API tests exist; full end-to-end UI, SSH, and
version-skew validation remains.

## Implementation Status On This Branch

Already partially landed:

- shared `Project` and `ProjectHostSetup` types
- compatibility projection from existing `Repo[]`
- persisted compatibility fields for projects and project-host setups
- renderer hydration and fallback for older runtimes
- project-aware sidebar grouping in existing repo grouping paths
- default all-host Projects sidebar keeps projects outermost while preserving
  host-section operational views for explicit host filters
- first-pass host context badges for mixed-host project groups, without adding
  badge noise to single-host project groups
- project-host-aware workspace creation target resolver
- optional workspace metadata for `projectId`, `hostId`, and
  `projectHostSetupId`
- setup-existing-folder API plumbing through local IPC/preload/runtime paths
- project settings existing-folder setup form for known local, SSH, and active
  runtime hosts
- CLI commands for listing projects/setups and creating worktrees by
  project/setup
- composer `Run on` selector when a project has multiple ready setups
- disabled `Run on` rows for known hosts where the selected project is not set
  up yet

Not complete yet:

- clone/provision flows
- inline setup actions from the composer `Run on` menu
- bulk setup flows and setup for hosts that are not already known to the client
- project settings split into global and host-specific ownership
- host settings/capability UI aligned with project setup
- complete cache/request ownership audit
- complete version-skew capability gating
- full Electron and SSH end-to-end validation

## Recommended Implementation Shape

Implement this as an additive migration.

1. Keep existing `Repo` APIs alive while adding project/setup records.
2. Use conservative identity matching so only reliably linked checkouts merge
   into one project.
3. Teach creation flows to resolve `{ projectId, hostId }` into the current
   backend through a ready setup.
4. Add setup-on-host flows for local and SSH.
5. Split settings into client, host, project, and project-host setup ownership.
6. Audit host-local caches and runtime routing.
7. Move visible default UX to project-first once behavior is real.
8. Preserve a host-first operational view/filter for troubleshooting.
9. Validate migration, creation, settings, sidebar, SSH, and version skew before
   calling the model complete.

## Final Position

Keep hosts visible, but do not make them the durable outermost object.

The durable model should be project-first because it better matches how users
think about repo/worktree/task work, while still supporting SSH machines, VMs,
remote servers, and future cloud compute as first-class places where a project
can run.
